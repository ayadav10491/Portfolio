## Behaviour based Control Strategy for Double Ackermann Steering Control of Bomag Autonomous Tandem Road Rollers

### Objective

<p align="justify">
The project work is an attempt to explore the autonomous capabilities of tandem rollers in the road construction. The project specifically focuses on analyzing the dynamics and
kinematics of tandem rollers, understanding the previously developed work on autonomous navigation including different levels of controls based on perception; later, extending
the same to the edge compaction module of the navigation system. The manual edge compaction for a roller is a complicated task which requires a skilled driver to drive through the edge with the front edge cutter and keeping the rear wheels away from the edge. The autonomous edge controller is an attempt to remove the driver involvement with the automated crab walk application in the roller.  </p>
