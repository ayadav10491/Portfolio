### 1. Embedded Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using TensorFLow Lite
<p align="justify">
This work explores the task of traffic scene segmentation using convolution neural network. The trained models are passed through 4 compression techniques (without quantization, Float16, Dynamic range, Int8) using TensorFlow Lite. The compression allows the model to achieve the maximum reduction of up to 91 percent with reduced noise.<br>

### 2. Behaviour based Control Strategy for Double Ackermann  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steering Control of Bomag Autonomous Tandem Road <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rollers
<p align="justify">
The projects explores the trajectory tracking application for road rollers during edge compaction task. The roller receives path information from the paver through a remote interface. The algorithm extracts the edge spline of the path and then is offset to create a trajectory for the rollers to maneuvre. The behaviour based control strategy allows the rollers to switch to crab steering mode of the "Edge Compaction mode is activated. <br>

### 3. Multi-Robot Formation Control using Graph Theory

<p align="justify">
The project is an attempt to achieve the decentralized multi-robot formation control with the help of graph theory. In particular, we have studied different characteristics of multi-robot systems and formation control strategies associated with them. The project consists of of three experiments involving the square formation control of four unicycle robots using decentralized coordination. <br>
