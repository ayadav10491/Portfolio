### 1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based Environment Analysis Through Semantic Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks
<p align="justify">
This work explores the task of traffic scene segmentation using convolution neural network. Furthermore, the dataset is trained using UNet [Ronnerberger 15] and SegNet [Badrinarayanan 17] encoder-decoder architectures with MobileNetV2  [Sandler 18] as an encoder. Out of the trained models, UNet-MobileNetV2 showcases dense segmentation results as compared to SegNet-MobileNetV2. For further compression both the trained models are passed through 4 compression techniques (without quantization, Float16, Float32, Int8) using TensorFlow Lite. The compression allows the model to achieve the maximum reduction of up to 91 percent with reduced noise.
