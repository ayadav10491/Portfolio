### Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based Environment Analysis Through Semantic Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Abstract
# This work explores the task of environment surveillance through unmanned aerial vehicles using convolution neural network based semantic segmentation. The thesis considers the "Semantic Drone Dataset" [TU Graz] and expand the same by introducing "Semantic Aerial Dataset- TUK" based on synthetic images from Google Earth. Furthermore, the dataset is trained using UNet [Ronnerberger 15] and SegNet [Badrinarayanan 17] encoder-decoder architectures with MobileNetV2  [Sandler 18] as an encoder. Out of the trained models, UNet-MobileNetV2 showcases dense segmentation results as compared to SegNet-MobileNetV2. For further compression both the trained models are passed through 4 compression techniques (without quantization, Float16, Float32, Int8) using TensorFlow Lite. The compression allows the model to achieve the maximum reduction of up to 74 percent with improved segmentation on 3 set of aerial scenarios  i.e TU Kaiserslautern- synthetic images, TU Kaiserslautern- real images and random aerial scenes. The comparison of segmented results of the compressed models with the respective original models and later with respect to each other (i.e between UNet-MobileNetV2 and SegNet-MobileNetV2) showcases that UNet-MobileNetV2 achieves better performance in terms of inference speed and segmentation quality.
